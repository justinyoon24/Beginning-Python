The hotel was reasonably priced and close to everything we wanted to see - ferry ride, Underground Tour, Klondike Museum, short walk to Pike Market and other shopping. The staff was amazingly helpful and accommodating. Our room was very clean and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. Before we booked, I read about some potential issues with the area. I can honestly say that the area was just fine! In fact, if you enjoy historic and quaint parts of town, this is definitely where you want to stay. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone who is headed to Seattle.',\n",

       " 'my husband and i just spent 6 nights in this hotel and loved every minute  the staff is friendly and efficient  we stayed for 4 nights  left to go to victoria bc  then came back for 2 more nights  the hotel has  old world  charm  the room decor is very well done   down to the drapery  carpet and nice artwork on the walls  the bathrooms are modern and nicely sized  the beds were very comfortable  the rooms and bathrooms were spotless  the linens were fresh and spotless as well  the fresh fruit and free bottled water was a nice touch and very much appreciated  the breakfast room was clean and always stocked with the daily offerings  the coffee was good and the waffles were addicting  even the elevator was fast and roomy  you don t realize how much you appreciate that until you go to another hotel where the elevators are sloooooow and tiny  as they were in our victoria bc hotel   the pioneer square area is lively and exciting with lots of little shops and restaurants  we walked around the area at night and didn t feel unsafe  other people mentioned street people as problematic  this is a fact of life in any large city  but none of the street people were aggressive or abusive  just a block away  they offer a tour of seattle underground which was interesting  pizza at mario s was delicious  dinner at elliott s oyster house at pier 56 was wonderful  we found seattle to be a great city with friendly people who are helpful and polite to tourists  we hope to visit again some day and when we do  we will again stay at the best western pioneer square hotel ',\n",
       " 'we stayed at the best western pioneer square for 2 nights prior to our alaskan cruise  this was a family reunion of sorts  and the hotel was wonderful in working with us to get 6 rooms with the set up needed for each family and all together on one floor of the hotel  hotel staff very nice to work with  this is a perfect location for walking around downtown seattle and the waterfront  very easy walking to pike street market  the waterfront  etc  hotel very kindly arranged taxi van service for all of us on the morning we needed to get to the pier with all of our luggage  rooms are small compared to some other hotels  but very clean and nice  free continental breakfast was nice  there was juice  coffee  cereals  milk  danish  bagels  toast  boiled eggs  etc  great price and great location  we will stay here on our next trip to seattle ',\n",
       " 'we stayed here for a girls  trip in a standard double double  the hotel is well located  across from the ferry docks  and within walking distance to public transportation  the rooms are small  and the view from our window was not great  but the staff was wonderful and the continental breakfast in the morning with eggs  yogurt  oatmeal  toast and muffins  fruit  etc  filled us up  we spent three nights here and had a wonderful time  i would not recommend this hotel for a big group or family  since the public spaces tend on the small side  nice get away for singles or couples trips ',\n",
       " 'spent 4 wonderful nights in seattle  caught a seahawks game  and did some sightseeing  the hotel staff was professional  the free continental breakfast was nice  and the room was comfortable for a family of four  the only flaw i found  our high speed internet connection did not work in the room  but  they have a computer in the conference room downstairs for guests so not a big issue  the area in pioneer square was nice and to all of the shops we hit on 1st ave  despite some older reviews concerning the homeless people we never encountered any aggressive homeless person nor did we ever feel threatened  the restaurant next to the hotel  julies garden  was good with big portions  but  our spot was the pho restaurant across the street from the hotel  we cant wait to come back to seattle for another seahawk mariner game  we will definitely stay at the best western pioneer square  john phillips',\n",
       " 'nice and clean  with some character  very friendly and helpful front desk staff  fantastic location ',\n",
       " 'my husband and i spent a week in seattle  basically did a sightseeing pub crawl tour of the city  this hotel is the only one in pioneer square  and it is within walking distance of everything  in fact  it s across the street from the waterfront  which is a popular place to go walking and sightseeing  we never rented a car or taxi  didn t need one  granted  we walked about 3 5 miles a day  but stopped anywhere we wanted along the way  you don t need a car in the city  and you have to call for taxis anyway   why not walk  the room was always clean  and a decent size for the two of us  it had a weird smell though  but it wasn t something we couldn t tolerate  though  it is very charming and cozy  and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars  in fact  out of all the meals we ate  the restaurant next door  al boccalino s  was the best  they provide room service for the hotel  and they have some of the best italian food i ve ever had  somewhat pricey  but it was so good  hotel staff were friendly  but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions i asked  such as  can they help with reservations for the victoria clipper  what bus   do we take to go to ballard  etc    but  they were very nice and always tried to help  the hotel was quiet when we were there  even though it seemed to be very crowded  i would recommend it to anyone  with our aaa membership  we paid  161 a night  except for friday night  which was more expensive ',\n",
       " 'we stayed at this hotel while in seattle on business  check in was very complicated they had no parking available when we arrived and the front desk staff was not helpful at all with the parking situation  our company was paying for the stay but when we arrived we had to wait 45 minutes for someone in the office to figure out what was going on  when we arrived in our room we were plesantly surprised it was large very clean and comfortable  the wireless internet left a lot to be desired very slow and constant drop offs  in the evening the noise from the freeway nearby was constant   for the money that this establishment cost we could have stayed in a sheraton or hilton and been a lot happier',\n",
       " 'i love this hotel  the staff was amazing  we had never been to seattle before and were probably terribly annoying with our endless questions and need for directions  but the staff was extremely patient and every person we talked to was just great  i can t say enough good things about the best western pioneer square  we chose it for the location  but the room was spotless and we had such a great time  we will definitely be back ']"
